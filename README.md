### Project Initiative

Develop a GUI for Tropical Cyclones.

The GUI should be able to:

- Display a table of cyclones.
- Sort this table by attribute.
- Filter this table by attribute.
- See a visualisation of the cyclone passing over a map.

In practise:

- Open the GUI to see a list of cyclones.
- Cyclones can be sorted by name, date or intensity.
- Cyclones can be filtered by countries they entered.
- Play the visualisation.

For example:
- User enters the application.
- User sorts the cyclones by date.
- User filters it down to cyclones in India.
- User can play a visualisation of each cyclone.
